To Do on Domain Tool
====================

 + I'd like the add/edit forms to be styled nicely to match the rest of the
   site

 + I'd like the 'expiry' on the domains to be in the format DD/MM/YYYY

 + I'd like the price to be nicely formatted

 + I'd like the price header to be 'Price per Year'

 + I'd like 'Expiry' to be 'Expiry Date'

 + I'd like in brackets after the expiry date, it shows number of days remaining,
   e.g. (01/01/2014 (30 days remaining)). This should be calculated at model level

Extras
-------

  - I'd like to be able to export the domain list as a CSV

  - I'd like to be able to import domains into the list, from the same format they
    were exported as.
